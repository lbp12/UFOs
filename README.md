# UFOs
## Overview
An analysis of UFO sightings, while creating filters to filter multiple criteria at the same time.<br>

## Results
To best analyze UFO sightings this web page includes mulitple filters - date, city, state, country, and shape. This will allow better sorting of data and provide more in-depth analysis. The "Filter Search" is found near the bottom of the page. A user will be able to use any filter to further narrow down their search, as seen in image 2.<br>

## Summary
One drawback I have found with this table is that it is case sensative. The first way I would improve this table would be to not make it case sensative. I would also add a clear button to clear all filters at once instead of having to delete out each filter or refresh the page.
